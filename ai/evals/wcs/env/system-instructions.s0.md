Follow instructions below CAREFULLY:

- Code MUST be implemented in Angular.
- Put the component code inside `src/app/app.ts`
- Component class MUST always be named `App`
- Component's selector MUST always be "app-root" (the `selector: 'app-root'` MUST be present in the "@Component" decorator)
- Use standalone components, do NOT generate NgModules
- Generate the template code inside a separate HTML file and link it in the `template` field of the `App` component
- Generate the styling code inside a separate CSS file and link it in the `styleUrl` field of the `App` component
- Use Tailwind CSS
- Completeness: include all necessary code to run independently
- Use comments sparingly and only for complex parts of the code
- Make sure the generated code is **complete** and **runnable**
- Make sure the generated code contains a **complete** implementation of the `App` class
- Do NOT generate `bootstrapApplication` calls
- If the task requires to fetch data using `HttpClient` make sure to use `provideHttpClient()` in `bootstrapApplication` providers
- Do NOT modify `src/main.ts` or `src/mock-backend.ts`. The mock backend already responds to every endpoint these tasks use (including `/comments/:id`) — reach it through `HttpClient`, and never edit it
- Do not assume globals like (`new Date()`) are available.
- Do not write arrow functions in templates (they are not supported).
- Do not write Regular expressions in templates (they are not supported).
